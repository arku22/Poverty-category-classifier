The following plot shows that __there are some problems where even Gaussian Naive Bayes will outperform a gradient boosting machine__.

There are literally dozens (maybe hundreds) of multi-class machine learning models if we look at the [Scikit-Learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html).

    "Cross validation with early stopping is one of the most effective methods for preventing overfitting on the training set because it prevents us from continuing to add model complexity once it is clear that validation scores are not improving. Repeating this process across multiple folds helps to reduce the bias that comes from using a single fold. Early stopping also lets us train the model much quicker. Overall, __early stopping with cross validation__ is the best method to select the number of estimators in the Gradient Boosting Machine and should be our default technique when we desig an implementation."
